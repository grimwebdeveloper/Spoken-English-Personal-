be the case
means that the
value of The
of the system
of view of
the work of
example of a
is the case
is that there
of the second
the change in
so that the
is not the
the area of
form of the
that is the
and in the
and the second
of the fact
the first is
that in the
and the same
out that the
the example of
that in a
is for the
be able to
blah blah blah

you know what I mean
you can see
trying to figure out
a little bit about
does that make sense
you know what
the university of michigan

to figure out what
so if you
so this is
if you want to
no no no
if you have
come up with a
we talked about
when you look at
in order to get
the end of the
oh my god
come up with
I was gonna say
and then you
a kind of
it doesn't matter
has to do with
you can look at
do you want me
little bit about
if you look
I just wanted to
you're talking about

it turns out
those of you who
you might want to
first of all
and so on and so
there was a
at the university of
yes yes yes
you can see that
I have a question
it has to be
we need to
what I'm saying
you want me to
all sorts of
as you can see
to figure out
keep in mind
what do you mean
it looks like
let's look at
you look at the
to make sure
if you wanted to
make sure that
end up with
and you can see
came up with
doesn't have to be
I mean if you
you've got a
gonna talk about
how many of you
I mean if

you know what I'm
that you can
we're looking at
what I mean
do you know what
how do you know
you don't need to
you're looking at
turns out that
it could be
figure out what
if you've got
I wanted to
you could you could
might be able
trying to figure
what you're saying
we have to
I'm talking about
so you can
this kind of
don't worry about
it's gonna be
if you have a
wanna talk about
so you can see
I want you to

you're trying to
a look at
if you were
you're interested in
to think about
gonna be able
by the way
we look at
I think this is
but if you
at some point
I'm gonna go
thank you very
can look at
